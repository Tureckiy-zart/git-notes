merging the remote changes into our local branches
works if we have local branches witch connected to remote
git pull origin doesn't works (need to specify branch name )

lacal br connected tj remote tracking br => git pull

git branch --track localBranchName origin/RemoteBranchName !!!!!!!!!

<!-- allows to track remote branch. now you can use git pull or push without typing ORIGIN -->

git branch --track origin/RemoteBranchName !!!!!!!!!

<!-- the same as prev but name will be as remote branch with "origin/branchName"-->

git push -u (-upstream) origin branch

<!-- will track remote  branch from start no need add --track command later  -->
